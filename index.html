  <div id = "Intro">
  <p id = "hello"></p>
    <p>I am Bhavicka, a second year Computer Science major at NYUAD. This spring of 2022, I took the class Communications Lab as part of my Interactive Media minor. I had known the basics of web-development theory but never applied them practically as websites with a purpose before. This class helped me change that, and this is a portfolio website for all my projects in the class! You can either scroll or click on the header tabs. I hope you enjoy :)</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class = parallax></div>
  
  <div id = "Zoom">
    <h2>Introducing Zoom</h2>
    <p>The first website for this class was made for a short video we created in class for the "30 Minute Film Festival" or 30MFF (although we did take a little more time than 30 minutes.</p>
    <p>My team for making the film had made an ironic commercial for Zoom, everyone's "favourite app" during the pandemic. It was tongue-in-cheek and badly edited on purpose, and I wanted the website I made for it individually to reflect that. That is why I went for a parodying sort of humour for the tone of the website (complete with an annoying pop-up). Click anywhere here to go visit it, I was proud of how bad it was! :p </p>
  </div>
  
  <div class = parallax></div>
  
  <div id = "Comic">
    <h2>Just Moved In</h2>
    <p>Our second project, and first group project, was to make an interactive comic strip website. I was very excited about this as I love a lot of online webcomics such as Loading Artist and theodd1sout which have a particular kind of art style and humour.</p>
  <p>My teammates and I decided to go for a typical horror story with a twist. The user could interact and choose one of two endings for our comic, and people loved them both. I was glad I was able to incorporate the kind of art-style I had hoped to recreate. Click on this section to check it out, I promise both the endings are worth it ;)</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class = parallax></div>
  
  <div id = "Sound">
    <h2>The Kidnapping of J Doe</h2>
    <p>The sound project was a long one but very satisfying in the end! We had a couple of ideas but in the end we decided to go with one which was the 5 stages of grief told through the diary of a kidnapping victim. This one dealt with heavy themes and required a careful consideration of the story and length.</p>
  <p>We learnt audio mixing for this project and along with our own voice-over narrations, the effects turned out very nice. For the website design, we wanted to show the passing of the seasons too, and each of the first 4 stages got a different weather animation as if looking out from a small dingy room, just like the victim had been. If you click on this portion and decide to check this one out then strap in, it's a long ride! :)</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class = parallax></div>
  
  <div id = "Video">
    <h2>Falcons News</h2>
    <p>This project was the one where we had the most amount of varying ideas in the beginning but turned out to be the most fun to work on too. We had to make an interactive video experience, and we decided to make something which was something like The Onion meeting Fox News, to create our very own Falcons News!</p>
    <p>These videos were very fun to shoot and script, and if you will check out the website you will know why. There is an interactive map feature, but the website is mostly meant to be something what a student-run news channel site might look like. Again, very tongue-in-cheek and parodying style of humour, and I have never met an NYUAD student who didn't see it and laugh, so if you are one, this is your sign to click on this and watch it ;) (others are of course welcome too, you just might not get some "inside jokes")</p>
